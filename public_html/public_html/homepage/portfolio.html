 My name is Kai and I'm an aspiring software developer, </p1>
	<p1 class ="reg" style="color:white; font-family:Trebuchet MS; font-size:110%">
		    I enjoy to code and learn about the vast capabilites of computers. This is my Portfolio Homepage, which details some of my previous completed projects. My focus is on front end development and web integration. I hope to one day specialize in creating new cross platform applications that fill unsatisfied market spaces. I have a broad spectrum of computer science knowlege. 

   Including:   <ul>
                <li> integrated programming with C, assembly, and general computer architecture, 
                <li>desktop application programming with C++, 
                <li> I am quite proficient in Java and I have developed several Android Applications,
                 <li>Javascript is currently the language that I am most entranced with,
                <li> I have experience with websockets and server trasfer protocol involving JSON,
                <li> XML and HTML are both markup languages that I have dealt with in the past,
                <li> I have a good mathematical background in discrete math, optimization, asymptotic growth and algorithms
                <li>  I understand the priciples behind most ADT's, and the edicit for module organization
                <li>Additionally I also know how to code in PHP, Python, and Ruby
                </ul>
                <br>

Most of my personal software projects have been video games because I am a Game Design Major at UCSC, 
but I know I could adapt to developing for many different types of projects. I am dedicated to the point of obsession.
I am also great at comprehending scripts that have been heavily abstracted.
